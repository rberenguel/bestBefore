        Here you can see the expiries of all tabs currently stored, as well as
        delete any <em>expiry</em> that may look weird. So, the red cross won't
        delete a tab, but the expiry date related to it. Tabs present in the
        expiry list internally but not in Chrome have been styled as `display:
        none`,
        <span
          id="toggle-visibility"
          style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer"
          >removing</span
        >
        this styling will let you interact with those (mostly used for
        debugging).
      </p>

      <p>
        When tabs are more than 6h close to expiry they will show in
        increasingly alarming shades of red.
      </p>

      <p>
        By clicking on the tab id button you can switch to that specific tab. If
        the tab is in another window though, window focus won't change.
